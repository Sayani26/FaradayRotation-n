FARADAY ROTATION
Introduction
This repository consists the python notebook demonstrating Faraday Rotation. Linear polarizedlight can be represented by two circularly polarized light (right and left). When travelling through a dielectric medium, each polarized light travels with different velocities. As a result at the receiver they arrive at the receiver with a phase difference and the combined linearly polarized light appears to have rotated by some angle. This phenomenon is called Faraday rotation.
Dependencies
The notebook requires the following python modules:
ipython matplotlib numpy
Usage
To access the notebook, clone the repository by typing
git clone https://github.com/Sayani26/Faraday-Rotation.git
Then open the notebook. Type,
cd Faraday-Rotation
cd FR
jupyter notebook faraday-rotation.ipynb
